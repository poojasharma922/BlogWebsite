            <h1>The heaven for Bloggers</h1> <br>
            <p>The best ideas can change who we are. Blog is where those ideas take shape, take off, and spark powerful conversations. We’re an open platform where over 100 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking. Here, expert and undiscovered voices alike dive into the heart of any topic and bring new ideas to the surface. Our purpose is to spread these ideas and deepen understanding of the world.</p>

                <p>We’re creating a new model for digital publishing. One that supports nuance, complexity, and vital storytelling without giving in to the incentives of advertising. It’s an environment that’s open to everyone but promotes substance and authenticity. And it’s where deeper connections forged between readers and writers can lead to discovery and growth. Together with millions of collaborators, we’re building a trusted and vibrant ecosystem fueled by important ideas and the people who think about them.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>A blank page is also a door. At Blog you can walk through it. It's easy and free to share your thinking on any topic, connect with an audience, express yourself with a range of publishing tools, and even earn money for your work.</p>
            <p>For us Blog producers, we have to decide whether Medium is a friend or a foe. They don't appear to have the financial constraints we have (like making money through advertising or subscriptions), which gives them a design leg up, and they also don't have the ethical constraints we have in what runs on their site. If we publish something plagiarized, it reflects poorly on us. If Medium publishes something plagiarized, it reflects poorly on the writer.</p>
            <p>Individual writers, too, should probably know what it means that their writing is going up on Blog. If Blog is a publication, their work is situated within the journalistic tradition, with goals separate from corporate imperatives. If Blog is a platform and the goal is for it to acquire more users, then everything that gets posted on its site is marketing for that platform itself, even the very best stuff. The payments to writers get filed under user acquisition, and belong in the business category "growth hacking."</p>
